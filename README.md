# Works4VC
A simple, mostly experimental (Model) View Controller PHP framework with pretty, '/index.php/ less' URLs.

## Tiny disclaimer:
The code for this framework is published and released 'as is'. It is pure experimental and was designed for our own use in the first place. You can make no claims and we don't claim responsibility for anything positive or negative that happens because you are using it. Also, I'm sure there are far better frameworks out there in terms of security, stability and what not. Either way, have fun if you decide to use it! ;-)
