# Works4VC
A simple, minimalist and mostly experimental (Model) View Controller PHP framework with pretty, '/index.php/ less' URLs.

Unlike other PHP frameworks, Works4VC doesn't come with any libraries or helpers of its own. You have to create these yourself. The aim of this framework is making it easier to quickly roll out your own web application with pretty URL structures and a separation of design and logic. There is no manual, API description or how-to. not yet, at least. If you have any questions, please contact Works4sure.

## Tiny disclaimer:
The code for this framework is published and released 'as is'. It is pure experimental and was designed for our own use in the first place. You can make no claims and we don't claim responsibility for anything positive or negative that happens because you are using it. Also, I'm sure there are far better frameworks out there in terms of security, stability and what not. Either way, have fun if you decide to use it! ;-)
